# SMS Spam Classifier

## Overview
The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine-learning project that aims to classify text messages as either spam or ham (non-spam). The classifier utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the content of the messages and predict whether they are spam or not. This project provides a practical application of machine learning in identifying and filtering out unwanted spam messages.

## Technologies Used
The project is implemented using the following technologies:
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)
- Scikit-learn
- Other relevant NLP and machine learning libraries for text preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.

## Dataset
The project utilizes a labelled dataset of SMS messages, with each message tagged as spam or ham. The dataset is not included in this repository due to size limitations, but a sample dataset can be obtained from [source link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

## Usage
To use the SMS Spam Classifier, clone the repository and follow the instructions in the project documentation. The system provides a user-friendly interface for users to input text messages and classify them as spam or ham.
